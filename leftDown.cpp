// STEPS of the solver:

   // find the pieces that we need: g and t0


   // draw conclusions based on logic

      // t0 [the minimum number of steps i can split (a,b) into to keep each step-size <= k]
      // g is [the maximum number of identically-sized steps i can split (a,b) into]

      // so g >= t0 is saying " â€œThe [maximum number of identically-sized steps I can split (a,b) into] is at least the [minimum number of steps i must split (a,b) into to keep each step-size <= k]" ==> i can use one operation pair over and over again to get to the goal
        // else (g < t0) means that the step-size that i get when i try to split (a,b) into identically-sized steps is larger than k ==> i cannot use just one operation pair to get to the goal
